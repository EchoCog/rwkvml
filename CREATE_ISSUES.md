# How to Create GitHub Issues from Generated Content

This document provides instructions for creating the comprehensive GitHub issues for Phases 2-6 of the Distributed Agentic Cognitive Grammar Network project.

## Overview

The issue generator has created **6 comprehensive issues** covering all remaining phases:

1. **Phase 2 Main**: ECAN Attention Allocation & Resource Kernel Construction
2. **Phase 2.1.1**: ECAN-Inspired Resource Allocators (detailed implementation)
3. **Phase 3 Main**: Neural-Symbolic Synthesis via Custom ggml Kernels
4. **Phase 4 Main**: Distributed Cognitive Mesh API & Embodiment Layer
5. **Phase 5 Main**: Recursive Meta-Cognition & Evolutionary Optimization
6. **Phase 6 Main**: Rigorous Testing, Documentation, and Cognitive Unification

## Files Generated

- `generated_issues.json`: Complete issue specifications with titles, bodies, and labels
- `issues_summary.md`: Human-readable summary of all generated issues
- `CREATE_ISSUES.md`: This instruction document

## GitHub Issue Creation Process

### Option 1: Manual Creation (Recommended for Review)

1. **Open GitHub Repository**: Go to https://github.com/EchoCog/rwkvml/issues
2. **Click "New Issue"** for each issue
3. **Copy Content from JSON**: Use the title and body from `generated_issues.json`
4. **Add Labels**: Apply the labels specified in the JSON file
5. **Assign to Project Members**: As appropriate

### Option 2: Automated Creation (Using GitHub CLI)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Install gh CLI if needed
# https://github.com/cli/cli#installation

# Authenticate (if not already)
gh auth login

# Create issues from JSON (you'll need to write a script)
# or create them manually using gh issue create
```

### Manual Creation Commands

For each issue in `generated_issues.json`, run:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "ISSUE_TITLE_HERE" \
  --body "ISSUE_BODY_HERE" \
  --label "label1,label2,label3"
```

## Issue Creation Order

**Recommended creation order:**

1. **Phase 2 Main** (Create first - it's the tracking issue)
2. **Phase 2.1.1** (Sub-issue of Phase 2)
3. **Phase 3 Main** (Next sequential phase)
4. **Phase 4 Main** (Next sequential phase)
5. **Phase 5 Main** (Next sequential phase)
6. **Phase 6 Main** (Final phase)

## Content Validation

Each generated issue includes:

- ✅ **Clear Title**: Descriptive and follows naming convention
- ✅ **Comprehensive Body**: Detailed specifications and requirements  
- ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable objectives
- ✅ **Technical Specifications**: Code structure and implementation details
- ✅ **Integration Points**: Dependencies and connections to other phases
- ✅ **Success Metrics**: Quantifiable success measures
- ✅ **References**: Links to related issues and documentation

## Labels Applied

Each issue has appropriate labels:
- `enhancement`: All issues are feature enhancements
- `phase-X`: Phase-specific labels (phase-2, phase-3, etc.)
- `tracking-issue`: For main phase coordination issues
- Specific labels like `attention-allocation`, `neural-symbolic`, `api`, etc.

## Dependencies

The issues properly reflect the dependency chain:
- **Phase 2** → Depends on Phase 1 (✅ Complete)
- **Phase 3** → Depends on Phases 1 & 2
- **Phase 4** → Depends on Phases 1, 2 & 3
- **Phase 5** → Depends on Phases 1, 2, 3 & 4
- **Phase 6** → Depends on all previous phases (1-5)

## Next Steps After Creating Issues

1. **Review and Prioritize**: Organize issues by priority and dependencies
2. **Create Milestones**: Set up GitHub milestones for each phase
3. **Assign Team Members**: Distribute work according to expertise
4. **Begin Implementation**: Start with Phase 2 development
5. **Track Progress**: Use issue updates to monitor development

## Architecture Foundation

All issues build upon the **completed Phase 1** foundation:
- `cognitive_grammar/` module with core components
- Tensor fragment architecture with hypergraph encoding  
- Prime factorization-based tensor shape registry
- Comprehensive verification framework
- Living documentation system

## Issue Templates Used

The generated issues follow a consistent template structure:

```markdown
# 🎯 [Phase Title]

[Brief description]

## 📋 Overview
- Dependencies
- Goals
- Scope

## 🎯 Sub-Issues / Tasks
