### Phase 6: Rigorous Testing, Documentation, and Cognitive Unification
- **Phase 6 Main Tracking Issue**: Final unification and testing coordination

## Architecture Foundation

All phases build upon the **completed Phase 1** foundation:
- `cognitive_grammar/` module with core components
- Tensor fragment architecture with hypergraph encoding
- Prime factorization-based tensor shape registry
- Comprehensive verification framework
- Living documentation system

## Next Steps

1. **Review Generated Issues**: Examine the detailed specifications in `generated_issues.json`
2. **Create GitHub Issues**: Use the generated content to create actual GitHub issues
3. **Begin Phase 2**: Start with ECAN attention allocation implementation
4. **Sequential Development**: Follow the dependency chain through phases 2-6

## Integration Points

Each phase builds on previous phases:
- **Phase 2** → Uses Phase 1's tensor fragments and hypergraph structure
- **Phase 3** → Uses Phase 2's attention allocation for neural-symbolic processing  
- **Phase 4** → Uses Phase 3's inference pipelines for distributed API access
- **Phase 5** → Uses Phase 4's mesh infrastructure for meta-cognitive optimization
- **Phase 6** → Unifies all phases into a complete cognitive system

**Total Implementation Scope**: 6 phases, comprehensive testing, full documentation, real-world verification
