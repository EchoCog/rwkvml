"""
Distributed Agentic Cognitive Grammar Network

Phase 1: Cognitive Primitives & Foundational Hypergraph Encoding

This module implements a distributed cognitive grammar network that bridges
symbolic reasoning and neural computation through RWKV-based tensor operations.

Architecture Overview:
- Scheme cognitive grammar microservices for agentic grammar â†” AtomSpace translation
- Tensor fragment architecture with hypergraph encoding
- Prime factorization-based tensor shape registry
- ECAN-inspired attention allocation foundation
- Modular design for neural-symbolic synthesis
